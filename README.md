# GAM-303 Unreal Prototype Repository

This repository contains my coursework project for **GAM 303** at Southern New Hampshire University.

## Project Title: Flux Conduit

**Flux Conduit** is a first-person puzzle game prototype built in **Unreal Engine 5**.  
The game is set in an abandoned energy research facility where the player solves environmental puzzles by interacting with power-based systems.

## Core Gameplay Systems

- **Power Batteries (Collectibles):**  
  Picked up through overlap + input, stored as a variable resource.

- **Power Cells (Physics Pickups):**  
  Carried one at a time and placed into sockets to power doors, platforms, or machinery.

- **Puzzle Progression:**  
  The prototype focuses on simple interactive puzzle rooms that teach mechanics through gameplay.

## Repository Purpose

This repo is used to track development progress, commits, and prototype features throughout the course.

## Tools Used

- Unreal Engine 5
- Blueprints (no C++ required for the prototype)
- GitHub for version control
