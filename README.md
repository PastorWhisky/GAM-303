# GAM-303 Unreal Prototype Repository

This repository contains my coursework project for **GAM 303** at Southern New Hampshire University.

## Project Title: Flux Conduit

**Flux Conduit** is a first-person puzzle game prototype built in **Unreal Engine 5**.  
The game is set in an abandoned energy research facility where the player solves environmental puzzles by interacting with power-based systems.

## Core Gameplay Systems

- **Power Batteries (Collectibles):**  
  Picked up through overlap + input, stored as a variable resource.

- **Power Cells (Physics Pickups):**  
  Carried one at a time and placed into buttons to power doors, platforms, or machinery.

- **Buttons & Interactive Elements:**  
  Pressure plates and buttons trigger mechanisms like doors and platform activation.

- **Door Systems:**  
  Doors that respond to power input and button activation to control puzzle progression.

- **Turret Prototype:**  
  Defensive mechanism prototype for environmental hazards. Possible feature to have players disable.

- **Puzzle Progression:**  
  The prototype focuses on simple interactive puzzle rooms that teach mechanics through gameplay.

- **Alpha Level:**  
  Playable alpha-level showcase demonstrating all alpha features together.

## Repository Purpose

This repo is used to track development progress, commits, and prototype features throughout the course.

## Tools Used

- Unreal Engine 5
- Blueprints (no C++ required for the prototype)
- GitHub for version control
